# Qmmp plugin for YouTube
This is a plugin for Qt-based Multimedia Player (Qmmp) to search and play musics directly from YouTube.


## Important notes

The plugin is not yet finished, that's why I don't have any description about how to install.
Currently, it is possible to search for musics on youtube and only some will play.
I didn't have time to finish it yet, but I hope I will get it soon.

Even though, if you want to test it, you can extract the source code of QMMP and clone this repository inside of the extracted folder. Then compile QMMP with `cmake` and copy the built file `libyoutube.so` to the General plugin folder of your current installation of QMMP.
Is possible that you exeperince problems to make it work...
